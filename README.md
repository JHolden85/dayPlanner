# dayPlanner
Day planner made for UCI Coding Bootcamp

This planer allows the user to write up their schedule hour by hour for an entire work day.

The user can add tasks and todo comment in each over and then have them saved in local storage.
The goal of this project was to develop the skills to edit html using Jquery and ajax, and then to save those changes in local storage so the user could recall them later.
